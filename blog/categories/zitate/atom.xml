<p><strong>DEBT BOMB</strong>
<em>(Lyrics by Dominic Frisby)</em></p>

<p>Aw, aw baby, yeah, ooh yeah, huh, listen to this</p>

<p>Mortages, cars, consumer shite
Government spending all through the night
Pensions and healthcare and welfare rights
Education , wars to fight</p>

<p>Run up a deficit, ignore the facts
Blame someone else, put up tax
I can’t deny we had a crack
But now we gotta pay it back</p>

<p>Debt bomb, debt bomb, you’re a debt bomb uh hu
The addiction to credit just goes on and on and on – give it to me
Debt bomb, debt bomb, you’re a debt bomb
A bail-out ooh you’re turn me on</p>

<p>You know what you’re doing to me don’t you. ha ha,
I know you do</p>

<p>If you can’t afford it don’t be ill at ease – no
Spend it anyway, you’ve got voters to appease
Take the prudent savers and just give them a squeeze
That’s the economics of Keynes</p>

<p>Quantitative easing, zero interest rates
Steal from the future, hide the bad mistakes
We gotta keep those asset prices high
Don’t matter if the credit’s dry</p>

<p>Debt bomb, debt bomb, you’re a debt bomb uh hu
Try to pay the debt off with inflation
Debt bomb, debt bomb, you’re a debt bomb
Malinvestment ooh you’re turn me on</p>

<p>A boom brought about by credit will always bust
You’ve then got two choices, decide you must
Abandon the addiction, the credit lust
Or the currency collapses , it just turns to worthless dust</p>

<p>Debt bomb, debt bomb, you’re a debt bomb uh hu
Destroy the country’s money, anything to carry on
Debt bomb, debt bomb, you’re a debt bomb
Bubbles ooh you’re turn me on</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>"</em>[...]<em> many liberal socialists are guided in their endeavors by the tragic illusion that by depriving private individuals of the power they possess in an individualist system, and by transferring this power to society, they can thereby extinguish power. What all those who argue in this manner overlook is that, <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/glance/index_de.htm">by concentrating power</a> so that it can be used in the service of a single plan, it is not merely transferred but infinitely heightened; that, by uniting in the hands of some single body power formerly exercised independently by many, an amount of power is created infinitely greater than any that existed before, so much more far-reaching as almost to be different in kind. It is entirely fallacious when it is sometimes argued that the great power exercised by a central planning board would be 'no greater than the power collectively exercised by private boards of directors.' There is, in a competitive society, nobody who can exercise even a fraction of the power which a socialist planning board would possess, and if nobody can consciously use the power, it is just an abuse of words to assert that it rests with all the capitalists put together. It is merely a play upon words to speak of the 'power collectively exercised by private boards of directors' so long as they do not combine to concerted action - which would, of course, mean the end of competition and the creation of a planned economy. <strong>To split or decentralize power is necessarily to reduce the absolute amount of power, and the competitive system is the only system designed to minimize by decentralization the power exercised by man over man. </strong>
We have seen before how the separation of economic and political aims is an essential guaranty of individual freedom and how it is consequently attacked by all collectivists. To this we must now add that the 'substitution of political for economic power' now <a href="https://derstandard.at/1332324022080/Nationalrat---Oberhauser-Der-ungeregelte-Finanzmarkt-ist-schuld-ander-Krise-nicht-die-Oesterreicherinnen-und-Oesterreicher">so often demanded</a> means necessarily the substitution of power from which there is no escape for a power which is always limited. What is called economic power, while it can be an instrument of coercion, is, in the hands of private individuals, never exclusive or complete power, never power over the whole life of a person. <strong>But centralized as an instrument of political power it creates a degree of dependence scarcely distinguishable from slavery.</strong>"</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>"This is the fundamental fact on which the whole philosophy of individualism is based. It does not assume, as is often asserted, that man is egoistic or selfish or ought to be. It merely starts from the indisputable fact that the limits of our powers of imagination make it impossible to include in our scale of values more than a sector of the needs of the whole society, and that, since, strictly speaking, scales of value can exist only in individual minds, nothing but partial scales of values exist—scales which are inevitably different and often inconsistent with each other. From this the individualist concludes that the individuals should be allowed, within defined limits, to follow their own values and preferences rather than somebody else's; <strong>that within these spheres the individual's system of ends should be supreme and not subject to any dictation by others</strong>. It is this recognition of the individual as the ultimate judge of his ends, the belief that as far as possible his own views ought to govern his actions, that forms the essence of the individualist position.
This view does not, of course, exclude the recognition of social ends, or rather of a coincidence of individual ends which makes it advisable for men to combine for their pursuit. But it limits such common action to the instances where individual views coincide; what are called 'social ends' are for it merely identical ends of many individuals—or ends to the achievement of which individuals are willing to contribute in return for the assistance they receive in the satisfaction of their own desires. <strong>Common action is thus limited to the fields where people agree on common ends. Very frequently these common ends will not be ultimate ends to the individuals but means which different persons can use for different purposes.</strong> In fact, people are most likely to agree on common action where the common end is not an ultimate end to them but a means capable of serving a great variety of purposes."</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"[...] <em>the universal struggle against competition promises to produce in the first instance something in many respects even worse, a state of affairs which can satisfy neither planners nor liberals; <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul665.html">a sort of syndicalist or 'corporative' organization of industry</a>, in which competition is more or less suppressed but planning is left in the hands of the independent monopolies of the separate industries. This is the inevitable first result of a situation in which the people are united in their hostility to competition but agree on little else.<strong> By destroying competition in industry after industry, this policy puts the consumer at the mercy of the <a href="http://alles-schallundrauch.blogspot.com/2011/10/der-korporatismus-ist-unser-feind.html">joint monopolist action of capitalists</a></strong> and workers in the best organized industries. Yet, although this is a state of affairs which in wide fields has already existed for some time and although much of the muddled (and most of the interested) agitation for planning aims at it, it is not a state which is likely to persist or can be rationally justified. Such independent planning by industrial monopolies would, in fact, produce effects opposite to those at which the argument for planning aims. Once this stage is reached, the only alternative to return to competition is the control of the monopolies by the state—a control which, if it is to be made effective, must become progressively more complete and more detailed. It is this stage we are rapidly approaching. </em>[...]
<em>If we are, nevertheless, rapidly moving toward such a state,</em>{img right http://frasier-crane.github.com/images/korporatismus.jpg 194 228 Korporatismus %}<em> this is largely because most people still belive that it is must be possible <a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/wagenknechts-neues-buch-sozialismus-aber-bitte-liberal/4374552.html">to find some middle way</a> between 'atomistic' competition and central direction. Nothing, indeed, seems at first more plausible, or is more likely to appeal to reasonable people </em>[...]<em> Yet mere common sense proves a treacherous guide in this field. Although competition can bear some admixture of regulation, it cannot be combined with planning to any extent we like without ceasing to operate on an effective guide to production. Nor is 'planning' a medicine which, taken in small doses, can produce the effects for which one might hope from it thoroughgoing application. <strong>Both competition and central direction become poor and inefficient tools if they are incomplete.</strong>"</em></p>
